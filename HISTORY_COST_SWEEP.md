# History-cost design-space sweep (direction 1) and rip-up-reroute prototype (direction 2)

Recorded 2026-09-06. Follow-on to `ZERO_OVERFLOW_CONVERGENCE_EXPERIMENT.md` and
`gr/iroute.cpp`'s own header. iroute's own tuning (additive step 0.02) beat
hroute's extended-round plateau on all three benchmarks but only by 0.5-2.7%.
This file records two follow-on experiments per the task brief: (1) pushing
the history-cost growth rate/trigger further than the original flat-additive
sweep, and (2) prototyping rip-up-reroute of already-committed nets.

Per CLAUDE.md's "Long-running work and background agents" section: raw
numbers land here as they're produced, never held only in conversation state.
Concurrent background processes capped at 3 throughout.

## Screening methodology

Full 172-round runs (iroute's own comparison basis) take ~2200-3100s per
benchmark -- too slow to screen many configs. Screening uses a reduced
round budget (`IROUTE_FAST_ROUNDS=30 IROUTE_SLOW_ROUNDS=40`, 70 rounds max)
on adaptec1 only (measured ~13s/round blended, so ~15 min/run). Any config
that wins the screen gets a full validation run (172-round budget, all
three benchmarks, gr_verify + eval2008.pl cross-check) before being adopted
or recorded as the new default.

## Part 1: history-cost growth rate/trigger sweep

### Screen 1 (adaptec1, 30 fast / 40 slow rounds, reduced budget)

Raw trace files: `/tmp` scratch dir during the run, final numbers below.

| config | env vars | overflow (62 rounds, adaptec1) |
|---|---|---|
| baseline_020 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.02` (current committed default) | 168946 |
| step_005 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.005` | 169538 |
| step_010 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.01` | 168828 |
| step_050 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.05` | **167724 (screen winner)** |
| mult_105 | `IROUTE_HIST_MODE=mult IROUTE_HIST_FACTOR=1.05` | 168696 |
| mult_102 | `IROUTE_HIST_MODE=mult IROUTE_HIST_FACTOR=1.02` | 168624 |
| streak3_020 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.02 IROUTE_HIST_STREAK=3` | 170770 (worst) |
| streak5_010 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.1 IROUTE_HIST_STREAK=5` | 170012 |
| scaleoverflow_005 | `IROUTE_HIST_STEP=0.005 IROUTE_HIST_SCALE=overflow` | 169130 |

All 9 configs screened, single run each (no repeats -- treat close results as
noise, not signal). Two clear qualitative findings: **streak-gating (delaying
growth until N consecutive over-capacity rounds) made things worse in both
variants tried**, the two worst results of the sweep -- letting a net drift
back onto a recently-congested edge for longer before the penalty kicks in
apparently costs more than it saves. **Overflow-magnitude scaling was
middling**, not clearly better than a well-chosen flat step. The screen
winner, `step_050` (flat additive step=0.05), beat the current committed
default (`step_020`, 168946) by ~0.72% at this reduced round budget --
notably a *larger* step than 0.02, which is the opposite direction from
what the original full-172-round sweep found (0.02 beat 0.1 there). This
open contradiction is exactly why the methodology above requires a full
172-round validation on all three real benchmarks before adopting anything
-- the optimal step size may not be a single constant independent of round
budget, and a screen-only result is not enough evidence either way.

### Full 172-round validation of the screen winner (step=0.05)

Bar to beat (iroute's currently-committed default, step=0.02, 172 rounds,
legal + eval2008.pl cross-checked): adaptec1 164094, newblue1 41314,
bigblue1 296914.

Launched 2026-09-06 ~12:21PM, all three benchmarks in parallel (3-process
cap respected).

| benchmark | step=0.02 (prior default) | step=0.05 | improvement |
|---|---|---|---|
| adaptec1 | 164094 | 163594 | -0.30% |
| newblue1 | 41314 | 41272 | -0.10% |
| bigblue1 | 296914 | 296534 | -0.13% |

All legal per gr_verify (0 disconnected/incomplete/unrouted/malformed),
all cross-checked exactly against eval2008.pl. A genuine, consistent win
on all three -- but notably smaller than the reduced-budget screen
predicted (~0.72% on adaptec1 alone, vs the ~0.30% that actually held up
at full scale). **Methodological lesson**: the 62-round screen is useful
for cheaply ruling out clearly-bad configs (it correctly identified both
streak-gating variants and step=0.005 as worse) and for ranking
plausible candidates, but its absolute margins should not be trusted --
only a full-budget validation run settles whether a lead is real and by
how much. Adopted step=0.05 as iroute's new default; see `gr/iroute.cpp`'s
header for the updated Result section and reasoning.
