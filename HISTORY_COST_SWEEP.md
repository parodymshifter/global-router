# History-cost design-space sweep (direction 1) and rip-up-reroute prototype (direction 2)

Recorded 2026-09-06. Follow-on to `ZERO_OVERFLOW_CONVERGENCE_EXPERIMENT.md` and
`gr/iroute.cpp`'s own header. iroute's own tuning (additive step 0.02) beat
hroute's extended-round plateau on all three benchmarks but only by 0.5-2.7%.
This file records two follow-on experiments per the task brief: (1) pushing
the history-cost growth rate/trigger further than the original flat-additive
sweep, and (2) prototyping rip-up-reroute of already-committed nets.

Per CLAUDE.md's "Long-running work and background agents" section: raw
numbers land here as they're produced, never held only in conversation state.
Concurrent background processes capped at 3 throughout.

## Screening methodology

Full 172-round runs (iroute's own comparison basis) take ~2200-3100s per
benchmark -- too slow to screen many configs. Screening uses a reduced
round budget (`IROUTE_FAST_ROUNDS=30 IROUTE_SLOW_ROUNDS=40`, 70 rounds max)
on adaptec1 only (measured ~13s/round blended, so ~15 min/run). Any config
that wins the screen gets a full validation run (172-round budget, all
three benchmarks, gr_verify + eval2008.pl cross-check) before being adopted
or recorded as the new default.

## Part 1: history-cost growth rate/trigger sweep

### Screen 1 (adaptec1, 30 fast / 40 slow rounds, reduced budget)
