// fr2route.cpp
//
// Forked from fr1route.cpp -- inherits the 2D collapse (Usage::capH/capV,
// h2dCount/v2dCount, the g.hIndex(x,y,0)-is-already-2D identity),
// vroute's MSMV maze growth, and kroute's own LIFO-relaxable history
// completely unchanged; see fr1route.cpp's, vroute.cpp's, and
// kroute.cpp's own headers for those. Generation 2 of the `fr` species
// (CLAUDE.md's "Router naming convention" addendum) -- a refinement of
// the same 2D-collapsed pricing loop, not a different core algorithm, so
// the letters stay the same and only the generation number advances.
// Scoped in /Users/bobboyd/.claude/plans/async-shimmying-pancake.md.
//
// Why: fr1route's 2D collapse cut overflow 10-35% versus full 3D routing
// but stayed far short of the zero contest winners reach on adaptec1/
// bigblue1, and a round-budget probe (HISTORY_COST_SWEEP.md Part 21's own
// follow-up) ruled out "just run it longer" -- ~60% more rounds bought
// under 2% further reduction everywhere. That leaves the two
// deliberately-deferred architectural gaps fr1route's own header named:
// topology quality (MST vs Steiner) and escalation sophistication. Per
// the user's own directive, this file tries escalation first.
//
// The gap: fr1route (and vroute before it) escalates in exactly two
// steps -- a fixed menu of ~8 L/Z pattern candidates per tree edge
// (generateCandidates), then straight to full, unrestricted, margin-
// expanding maze/MSMV search for anything still overflowed. Real
// ISPD-competitive routers (FastRoute in particular) escalate gradually:
// pattern routing, then a cheaper but still-real per-edge search
// restricted to *monotonic* paths (every step moves toward the target,
// never backtracks) confined to the net's own tight bounding box, and
// only nets still overflowed after that escalate to full maze search.
// The monotonic tier can find any staircase path in the bounding box --
// far more than the ~8 fixed L/Z shapes -- at a fraction of full maze
// search's cost (no margin expansion, no multi-source growth, a DAG
// rather than a general graph).
//
// The mechanism: `monotonicDijkstra` mirrors `boundedDijkstra`'s own
// Dijkstra-over-SearchRegion structure with two restrictions: no margin
// expansion (the region is exactly the net's own bounding box) and
// monotonic neighbor generation (from (x,y), only the one horizontal and
// one vertical neighbor that reduce distance to the target are ever
// relaxed -- never the neighbor that would move away). `RoutedNet::tier`
// (a new three-value `Tier{Fast,Monotonic,Maze}` enum, replacing the old
// boolean `escalated`) only ever increases, the same discipline the old
// flag already enforced. A new Phase B, structurally identical to the
// old (now Phase C) maze-tier round loop -- same supervised accept/
// reject via overflowOverUnion, same round-boundary updateHistory call,
// same patience-based early stop -- tries the monotonic tier first;
// only nets still overflowed after Phase B's own loop converges, stalls,
// or hits its cap escalate further to Phase C's full maze search.
//
// FR2ROUTE_MONOTONIC=0 skips Phase B entirely (every net that overflows
// past the fast tier escalates straight to Maze), reproducing fr1route's
// exact two-tier behavior for direct comparison -- the same "strict
// superset, never a regression" pattern every prior escalation flag in
// this project uses.
//
// 68 self-tests pass, including the decisive one: on a fixture where a
// "wall" blocks every column/row the fast tier's fixed L/Z menu could
// ever turn at (0, 2, 4, 6, 8 -- the only columns generateCandidates ever
// tries), the real production routeNetFast cannot legalize the net, but
// the real production routeNetMonotonic -- free to turn at any column,
// including the odd ones (1, 3, 5, 7) the fixed menu never considers --
// finds the gap and legalizes it cleanly.
//
// Measured result, default settings (FR2ROUTE_MONOTONIC=1, same round
// budget convention as fr1route's own baseline), all three real ISPD
// benchmarks. All legal per gr_verify (0 malformed/disconnected/
// incomplete/unrouted/out-of-bounds):
//
//   benchmark   fr1route (2D overflow, bar)   fr2route (2D overflow)
//   adaptec1    69394                         76296   -- +9.9%, 2898s
//   newblue1    20040                         21644   -- +8.0%,  583s
//   bigblue1    207612                        223026  -- +7.4%, 3118s
//
// **Not dramatic -- the opposite of dramatic.** A clean, unanimous
// regression, 7-10% worse on all three, while running *more* total
// rounds than fr1route's own baseline (222-223 vs 172-173) -- not an
// under-converged comparison. Per the user's own decision criterion,
// this triggers the stated fallback directly: try Steinerization next.
//
// Working diagnosis: the escalation ladder's accept/reject gate
// (overflowOverUnion, unchanged from fr1route/vroute) only checks that a
// net's own *local* overflow doesn't get worse, not whether the accepted
// route is as good as a stronger tier would have found. Once a net
// resolves via the monotonic tier, `tier` only ever increases, so it is
// never reconsidered by Phase C's full, unrestricted maze/MSMV search --
// including cases where MSMV would have found a shorter or better-
// distributed path. The monotonic tier can "steal" nets into a locally-
// legal but globally worse route, permanently, before the stronger
// search ever gets a chance. This is a real structural cost of
// *sequential* graduated escalation paired with a *local-only*
// acceptance gate, not an implementation bug -- the mechanism does
// exactly what its own self-tests prove (finds a real monotonic path the
// fixed pattern menu cannot); "resolves this net's overflow" and "is a
// good route" are simply not the same claim, and the gate only checks
// the first. See HISTORY_COST_SWEEP.md Part 22 for the full record,
// including the note that a global-cost acceptance rule (closer to
// FastRoute's own real approach) might avoid this, left for a future
// session per the user's own directive to move to Steinerization now.

// both terms together, and threading two structs through the same call
// chains that already thread one is a needless chance to pass the wrong

// `streakH`/`streakV` count consecutive round-boundary over-capacity

// `scaleByOverflow` (VROUTE_HIST_SCALE=overflow): instead of a flat step
// (or a flat factor) applied uniformly to every over-capacity edge
// regardless of how far over it is, scale by the current round's
// usage/capacity ratio -- an edge at 3x capacity accumulates history three
// times as fast as one just barely over. This is the one asymmetry between
// history's update and lambda's own: lambda already scales with
// usage/capacity via priceExponentTerm; history previously did not. Ratio
// is computed from THIS round's usage even when growth is gated by a
// multi-round streak, matching "how bad is it right now that finally
// triggered growth," not an average over the streak.
// `relaxEnabled` (VROUTE_HIST_RELAX, default true): when an edge is over
// capacity, the growth applied this round is pushed onto that edge's
// histOps stack as well as applied to histH -- exactly what was applied,
// not the nominal step/factor, so a clamp against kHistoryCap still undoes
// cleanly. When an edge is *not* over capacity and its stack is non-empty,
// the single most-recently-pushed operation is popped and undone (additive:
// subtract; multiplicative: divide), clamped at the 1.0 floor as a defensive
// guard against floating-point drift after many push/pop cycles -- by
// construction this should never actually bind (each push and its eventual
// pop are exact inverses), but the guard costs nothing and this project's
// own arithmetic-edge-case discipline (CLAUDE.md) asks for a stated bound on
// any quantity that changes over many rounds. `relaxEnabled=false`

// This file's own new mechanism: a monotonic-maze middle tier between the

// margin-expanding maze search below. See the file header for the full
// motivation (FastRoute's own graduated escalation). Two deliberate
// restrictions relative to boundedDijkstra, both load-bearing:
//
//   - No margin expansion: the search region is exactly the net's own
//     bounding box. This tier is supposed to be cheap, not exhaustive --
//     margin expansion, and the full omnidirectional relaxation it needs
//     to be worth doing, is what the Maze tier below is for.
//   - Monotonic neighbor restriction: from (x,y), only the horizontal
//     neighbor that moves strictly toward p2.x (none if x==p2.x) and the
//     vertical neighbor that moves strictly toward p2.y (none if
//     y==p2.y) are ever generated -- never the neighbor that would move
//     away. This makes the search a DAG (every path is length-monotonic
//     in both axes) and strictly cheaper per node than boundedDijkstra's
//     full 4-neighbor relaxation, while still finding *any* staircase
//     path in the bounding box -- far more than the fixed L/Z menu's ~8
//     shapes (see testMonotonicTierResolvesWhatFastTierPatternMenuCannot).
//     A monotonic path always exists whenever p1 != p2 (the region is
//     fully connected under this restriction), so this function has no
//     margin-retry loop the way routeSegment does -- there is nothing to
//     expand into.

// Multi-source multi-sink (MSMV) maze routing -- this file's own new
// mechanism. See the file header for the full motivation. Every prior
// router in this lineage builds a net's Steiner topology once, up front,
// from an abstract Manhattan-distance MST over the pins (`mstEdges`), then
// routes each fixed tree edge as an independent 2-terminal search between
// its two specific endpoint pins. That has two structural limits real
// competition routers (FastRoute, NTHU-Route) avoid: the topology itself is
// decided before any congestion information exists, and a tree edge can
// only attach at its two designated pin endpoints, never at some other
// point along wire the net has *already* committed elsewhere.
//
// MSMV routing removes both limits by growing the tree incrementally with
// real search instead of committing to an abstract topology at all: start
// connected with just one pin; repeatedly treat every tile the net has
// committed so far as a simultaneous source and every not-yet-connected
// pin as a simultaneous sink, and run one Dijkstra wave to find the
// genuinely cheapest next connection, wherever it attaches. Whichever pin
// is reached first joins "connected"; repeat until every pin is in the
// tree. This is literally Prim's algorithm, but each step's edge weight is
// a real congestion-aware grid search instead of an abstract Manhattan
// distance, and reconnection can tap into the middle of already-built wire
// (see testMSMVAttachesToExistingWireNotJustPinEndpoints below for a fixture
// where this measurably shortens the tree relative to a fixed topology).

// capacity but has quietly kept the current-round pricing (lambda) climbing
// this whole time for unrelated reasons (other nets still contending for
// it). Under hroute's pricing alone (no history, or equivalently
// VROUTE_HIST_STEP=0) layer 0's frozen-but-lower lambda wins every time,
// even though nothing about the grid says returning to it is actually
// safe -- the exact "drift back" failure this file exists to fix. With
// permanent history accumulated against layer 0 from its earlier overflow,
// the same comparison flips.
// vroute's own testHistoryCostPreventsDriftBackToPreviouslyCongestedEdge
// is removed here: its whole premise was comparing bestHLayer's choice
// between two different *real* layers (one recently congested and now
// clear, one steadily moderate) -- a comparison this file's 2D collapse
// makes inapplicable, since there is only ever one synthetic layer to
// choose (LayerPlan::hLayers/vLayers are both {0}). The history-relax
// mechanism itself remains fully covered by the direct-arithmetic tests
// below (testRelaxationUndoesExactlyOneStepPerCleanRound and its
// siblings), which exercise updateHistory's own real production code, not
// a layer-choice comparison built on top of it.

// CLAUDE.md's arithmetic-edge-case section requires a test for every
// formula that can see a degenerate input, not just the happy path.
// updateHistory has no division (a plain usage > capacity comparison), so
// there is no capacity_e == 0 divide-by-zero to reproduce here the way
// priceExponentTerm has one -- but a zero/negative capacity edge is still a
// degenerate case worth a named test, because the *wrong* answer (silently
// accumulating history against an edge that was never usable) would still
// compound every round for the rest of the run without ever crashing,
// exactly the "wrong code still runs and still produces a route, just a
// worse one" failure mode CLAUDE.md warns about. Adapted for this file's
// own 2D collapse: kBasicGr's layer 1 alone being blocked (hcap 0) is not
// enough here, since the *summed* 2D capacity is layer 0's nonzero value
// plus layer 1's zero -- a genuinely nonzero 2D edge. The fixture needs
